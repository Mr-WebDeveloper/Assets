# Muthus_Blog

Hello, everyone! Welcome to my GitHub.

In this, I have created a website that displays blogs to practice the creation of my own API.

I have also created an 'index.js' file that acts as an API. If a request is sent from 'server.js,' the JSON data is received as a response from 'index.js.'

Here, 'index.js' acts as an API.

You can perform CRUD operations on this site.

**# To_Start** 

1. Download and open the code in your editor (I'm using VSCode).

2. Open the terminal and ensure you are in the correct path targeting the current directory.

3. Use 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install the necessary libraries that I have used in this code.

4. After installing the libraries, install nodemon globally by using 'npm install -g nodemon.' (It helps to restart the server automatically after changes).

5. To, run our code.

6. Two files need to be run simultaneously to make the website visible.

7. In the first terminal, use 'nodemon server.js' to run the 'server.js' file; it acts as the front end for us.

8. Open a new terminal and use 'nodemon index.js' to run the 'index.js' file; it acts as the API for our project.

9. Go to 'localhost:3000' to see the output.

10. The blog website is ready.
